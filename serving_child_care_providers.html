Before you become a licensed home daycare provider, it's crucial to understand the certification process and training mandates.</p>
      
          <p>In Maryland, home daycare is referred to as Family Childcare. Family Childcare providers offer care in their homes to children who aren't related to the provider. To ensure a safe environment, Maryland imposes limits on the number of children in a family childcare home:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Family Child Care Home:</strong> Providers may care for up to eight children, with no more than two under the age of two. The provider's own children under the age of six are included in the group of eight.</li>
      
            <li><strong>Large Family Child Care Home:</strong> Providers may care for between nine and 12 children, with no more than four under the age of two. The provider's own children under the age of six are included in the group of nine to 12.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>Aspiring Family Child Care Providers in Maryland must meet the following requirements from the Maryland State Department of Education Division of Early Childhood Licensing Manual:</p>

            <li>Pass a criminal background check.</li>
            <li>Pass a health screening.</li>
            <li>Have a safe and well-equipped home.</li>
            <li>Sign a home daycare agreement with each child's parent or guardian.</li>
            <li>Have a current certificate indicating successful completion of training in various areas, including child development, program curriculum, child health and safety, care of children with disabilities, provider professionalism, community resources, and emergency and disaster planning.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>In addition to these trainings, home daycare providers in Maryland must also complete:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li><strong>CPR, First Aid and BLS Certification:</strong> This certification is mandatory for all home daycare providers, regardless of the age of the children they will be caring for.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):</strong> This training covers how to comply with the ADA's requirements for accessibility and inclusion.</li>
            <li><strong>Support for breastfeeding mothers:</strong> This training covers how to support breastfeeding mothers and their children.</li>
