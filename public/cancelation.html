        <h2>CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Refunds will not be issued once registration is processed.</li>
            <li>In the event of a class cancellation, full credits are available for up to 90 days from the original class date, subject to associated fees.</li>

            <li>Fenote Training Academy reserves the right to cancel classes due to natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, MTA suspension, building shutdowns, or other uncontrollable causes. In such cases, rescheduling without penalty or holding credit without expiration is allowed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>RESCHEDULING POLICY</h2>

        <p>To reschedule, contact us at <a href="mailto:ftrainingacademy21@gmail.com">ftrainingacademy21@gmail.com</a>, providing proof of attempted communication. Rescheduling is allowed once per course within 90 days of the original class date.</p>
