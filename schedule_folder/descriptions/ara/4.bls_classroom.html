    <p>  The Basic Life Support (BLS) course provides healthcare providers and public safety professionals the knowledge and skills necessary to respond to breathing and cardiac emergencies in adults, children, and infant patients.
        Consistent with the American Red Cross Focused Updates and Guidelines 2020, BLS is the foundational CPR/AED program typically required for healthcare providers and public safety professionals.
        Through the use of lecture, skills demonstration, practice, and case-based emergency response scenarios with a focus on team-based response, BLS builds the key critical thinking, problem-solving, and team dynamic skills that are needed to drive better patient outcomes.
        Upon successful completion of the course, learners will receive a 2-year Basic Life Support digital certificate with anytime, anywhere access to the certificate and training history.
        The American Red Cross is an accredited provider of continuing education by the Commission on Accreditation for Prehospital Continuing Education.
