        <b>  Course Format:        </b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Blended Learning: The course is divided into two parts – an online portion and a skills verification session with a live trainer.            </li>
            <li>Online Portion: Students complete the first part of the course online, which can be done from home or office. The online link for this portion is provided separately. Upon completion, you will be issued a certificate that you will need to present on the day of the skills verification session.             </li>
            <li>Skills Verification: After completing the online portion, students need to attend a skills verification session with a live trainer.             </li>
          
        </ul>


        <b>  Skills Verification:        </b></p>
        <p> Skills verification sessions can be scheduled in two different formats.        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The first format is a traditional in-person face-to-face training held at our corporate office 839 Quince Orchard Blvd Suite E, Gaithersburg, MD 20878.
            </li>
            <li>Remote Skills Verification (RSV) sessions can also be scheduled. In this format, a loaner manikin is mailed to your location and you will log in to a live Zoom session with an HSI trainer where you will practice your skills.            </li>
          
        </ul>
        

        <p>
            Upon successful completion of the course, students will receive a 2-year HSI First Aid & CPR AED certification card. This certification will demonstrate that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to provide first aid, CPR, and use an AED effectively.

            RSV is a revolutionary new way to get full certification training in CPR, AED, First Aid and Phlebotomy from a live, authorized HSI Instructor. RSV is fully remote so you can take training anywhere—from the comfort of your home or anywhere you have an internet connection.
            
            With RSV you’ll get blended training in CPR, AED, or First Aid. Take the online portion first, and then schedule your live session where you’ll get real-time feedback and guidance from an authorized HSI instructor.
