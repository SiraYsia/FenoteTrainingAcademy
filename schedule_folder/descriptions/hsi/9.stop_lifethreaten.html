    </p>

    <p> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, traumatic injury is one of the leading causes of death for people under 50 years of age in the United States. A large portion of those deaths are from severe bleeding â€“ the most treatable cause of death due to trauma.

        The HSI Stop Life-Threatening Bleeding program is a completely revised and updated training program, integrating the latest and new Stop Life-Threatening Bleeding procedure.
        
        This program uses a step-by-step procedure and skill guide to provide guidance for assessing, prioritizing, and stopping life-threatening bleeding based on scientific evidence, national guidelines, and the consensus of experts.
        
        HSI Stop Life-Threatening Bleeding is an excellent supplement to our CPR and First Aid programs. </p>

    <p> 
        <b>The HSI Stop Life-Threatening Bleeding program teaches participants how to:        </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess the safety of the scene</li>
            <li>Take standard precautions using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)</li>
            <li>Evaluate a person to determine whether they have life-threatening bleeding</li>
            <li>Activate EMS and/or your emergency action plan (EAP)</li>
            <li>Stop life-threatening bleeding by manual pressure, wound packing, and/or applying a tourniquet</li>
        </ul>
