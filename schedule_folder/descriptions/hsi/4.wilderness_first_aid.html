    <p> Wilderness environments create special situations not usually encountered in an urban or suburban environment. With the Wilderness First Aid class, first aid providers in a remote outdoor setting will be better prepared to respond with wilderness first aid training when faced with limited resources, longer times to care for someone, and decisions about when and how fast to evacuate an ill or injured person.

        This comprehensive 16-hour wilderness first aid course meets or exceeds the Boy Scouts of America Wilderness First Aid Curriculum and Doctrine Guidelines, 2017 Edition. </p>
