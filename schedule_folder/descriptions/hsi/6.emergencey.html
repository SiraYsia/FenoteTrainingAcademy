    <p> Serious and life-threatening medical emergencies often cause oxygen to be depleted in the body. The HSI Emergency Use of Medical Oxygen program focuses on how to administer emergency medical oxygen to breathing and non-breathing persons using oxygen delivery systems.

        Using updated 2020 Guidelines, Emergency Use of Medical Oxygen training is useful for First Aid | CPR AED and/or BLS providers who may find themselves treating hypoxia in emergency situations such as the depressurization of an aircraft cabin, decompression illness in scuba divers, drowning, carbon monoxide poisoning, or other critical illnesses and injuries, including cardiac arrest.
        
        HSI Emergency Use of Medical Oxygen is an excellent supplement to our First Aid | CPR AED and BLS programs. </p>
