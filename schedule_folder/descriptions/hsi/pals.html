    </p>

    <p> The ASHI Pediatric Advanced Life Support (ASHI PALS™) program is a CAPCE-approved,
        scenario (case-based) continuing education course intended for trained and skilled healthcare
        providers who either direct or participate in cardiopulmonary and resuscitation emergencies
        in children. Based on the official text of the program, PALS Study Guide, 4th Edition by 
        Barbara J Aehlert RN BSPA, ASHI PALS provides students with an opportunity to enhance
        and refine their knowledge and hands-on skill proficiency in emergency cardiovascular care.
