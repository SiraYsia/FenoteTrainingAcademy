    <h3>Accelerated Phlebotomy Course</h3>

    <p><strong>Course Format:</strong> <span style="color: red;">BLENDED</span> - Our program combines online and in-person instruction, providing a comprehensive learning experience. The online portion allows for flexible, self-paced learning, while the in-person training delivers hands-on practice with expert instructors. This blended approach ensures students are thoroughly prepared for the exam and their future careers in phlebotomy.</p>

    <p><strong>Online Training:</strong> The online portion is accessible 24/7, allowing students flexible, on-demand access to course materials. Completion of the online portion is required before attending the in-person training. Completing your online course will take three weeks. After finishing the online portion at your own pace, you'll attend a in-person training during the fourth week. </p>

    <p><strong>In-Person Training:</strong> The in-person training spans 2 - 3 days and is onsight. These sessions feature engaging, interactive lessons designed to maximize student interaction and provide continuous feedback and support. This hands-on approach allow students to apply their online learning in a practical setting, enhancing their skills and confidence.</p>

    <p><strong>Exam:</strong> We also offer an online exam to further enhance students' knowledge before the National Phlebotomy Exam. This preparatory exam allows students to test their understanding of the course material and identify any areas needing additional study. By simulating the conditions of the actual exam, it helps build confidence and ensures that students are well-prepared for success.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Applicants must be 18 or older with a high school diploma.</p>
