    <h3>Accelerated Phlebotomy Course</h3>

    <p><strong>Course Format:</strong> <span style="color: red;">BLENDED</span> - Our program combines online and in-person instruction, providing a comprehensive learning experience. 1. What is Phlebotomy? Phlebotomy is the practice of drawing blood from patients for medical testing, transfusions, research, or donations. It's a crucial procedure used in diagnosing and monitoring a patient's health condition.
        2. Why Phlebotomy Training? Phlebotomy training is essential because it equips individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to safely and efficiently collect blood samples. The training covers various techniques, patient interaction, safety protocols, and legal aspects of the profession. Phlebotomy is a specialized skill that requires precision, care, and an understanding of human anatomy.
        3. Function of Phlebotomy: The primary function of phlebotomy is to obtain blood specimens from patients for laboratory analysis. These samples help in diagnosing diseases, monitoring conditions like diabetes, or determining the levels of various substances in the blood (e.g., cholesterol, glucose). Phlebotomy also plays a role in blood donation, where the collected blood is used for transfusions.
        4. The Role of Phlebotomy: Phlebotomists are healthcare professionals who perform the task of drawing blood. Their role involves:
        Preparing patients for blood collection
        Performing venipuncture (the process of accessing a vein to draw blood)
        Ensuring the correct labeling of samples
        Maintaining patient comfort and safety
        Following infection control protocols
        Working closely with laboratory personnel to ensure timely processing of samples
