          <h2>CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION</h2>
          <p>In the course of a lifetime, individuals may witness over a thousand significant accidents. Among these incidents, some may occur where you could potentially be the first responder. Basic training in CPR and First Aid can be the decisive factor in saving both another person's life and your own. Swift action is crucial, as a person in need of CPR must receive treatment within 3 minutes to prevent severe neurological damage.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Immediate Response Matters</h3>
          <p>Waiting for healthcare providers might not be an option, and someone on the scene must perform CPR. Millions of non-medical professionals and ordinary individuals acquire CPR and AED skills to assist until EMT/911 assistance arrives, making a significant impact on life and death situations. Fenote Training Academy adheres to guidelines set by the American Red Cros, Health & Safety Institute, and American Heart Association, OSHA, and Emergency Cardiovascular Care standards.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Professional Instruction</h3>
          <p>Our team of certified instructors readies individuals to handle emergency or trauma situations. Information and training materials from professional emergency responders and organizations like the American Red Cross and American Heart Association provide insights into appropriate responses during emergencies, potentially saving lives.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Certification Process</h3>
          <p>CPR, or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, should be a fundamental skill for everyone, refreshed regularly through courses. Performing CPR on-site where an incident occurs is essential. CPR AED certifications are not merely convenient skills with certifications but critical life-saving skills.</p>
          <p>The online CPR AED segment allows individuals to learn at their own pace. After successfully completing the online certification, participants gain access to practical live classes. Completion of the online CPR and classes is necessary for overall course completion. In case you're unable to finish the classroom education part, you have the flexibility to return and complete the class for free within 60 days of the initial class date.</p>
          <p>CPR Certification and CPR AED Certification can be conveniently digitally downloaded, including certifications, exam results, and instructor notes. Fenote Training Academy offers a variety of courses available by date on the Schedule webpage. These educational programs and course materials can certify individuals for free or at a nominal cost, depending on the program.</p>
